## Report issues

You can [create issues](https://github.com/ohmyform/ohmyform/issues/new) to report bug or request feature.

## Write code

Here is how to setup your development environment:

### Clone the project

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ohmyform/ohmyform
```

### Run the server locally

```
$ docker-compose up
```

You should have at this point have a working instance to play with at <http://localhost:5000> within moments.
