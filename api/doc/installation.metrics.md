# Installation Metrics

Attention: OhMyForm now collects completely anonymous 
telemetry regarding usage. This information is used to 
shape OhMyForm's roadmap and prioritize features.

If you want to opt out you can disable this behavior by 
setting the environment variable `DISABLE_INSTALLATION_METRICS=1`

You can take a look [here](../src/service/installation.metrics.service.ts) to see how we trigger the metric 
collection
